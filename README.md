# TTY PHP Reverse Shell

By Evan Stella

Intended for **legal/educational purposes only**. Don't do anything stupid, I assume no liability for damage caused to systems. 

*Usage*: 

Change params at the top of the script as needed, then upload to target and begin listening on the inputted port.


*TTY functionality*:

The script attempts to spawn a tty shell using python; this will fail if python is not installed on the target system.
