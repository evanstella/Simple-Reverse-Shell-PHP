# Simple PHP Reverse Shell

By Evan Stella

Intended for **legal/educational purposes only**. Don't do anything stupid, I assume no liability for damage caused to systems.

*Usage*

I've used this for CTF challanges when given the opportuntity to upload malicious PHP code to a system. There are fields at the top of the script for the destination address and port to send the shell to.
